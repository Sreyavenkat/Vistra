Vistra is a Linux-based hybrid ransomware detection and prevention framework designed to protect systems from both known and unknown ransomware attacks. It combines static signature-based scanning with real-time behavioral analysis to detect malicious activity early and automatically mitigate threats before files are encrypted.
